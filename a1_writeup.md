# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

    
1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
    # My initial thoughts on the python programming language is that it's pretty difficult to understand when someone is first trying to learn it. I haven't worked a lot with coding in general so learning python has been a little bit of a challenge.




2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
    # Some of the similarities to other programs that I have used in the past is that you have to put in a command to get the output that you want. Something different from the languages that I've coded in is the way that I have to put the command in. 



3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
    # I learned the basics of python because I have never coded in that language before.
